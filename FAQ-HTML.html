			<h3 id = "q1">What is the Urban Sciences Building?</h3>
			<p>The Urban Sciences Building, or USB for short, is a new facility at Newcastle University which is designed for students in the School
			of Computing.</p>
			<h3 id = "q2">Can I book a room?</h3>
			<p>USBFree currently does not provide any means of being able to book a room. This is because we do not have the capabilities to be able to
			book a room directly, and neither do any of the students who study Computing. Furthermore, requests will need to be taken through the Computing
			reception, which is impossible in the app alone.</p>
			<h3 id = "q3">What are the maps for?</h3>
			<p>They are floor plans for the building. They should help you easily find your way around.</p>
			<h3 id = "q4">Does this app work on iPhone?</h3>
			<p>At the current time of writing, there is no iPhone support because of lack of compatibility.</p>
